# Proctoring-AI
Creating a software for automatic monitoring in online proctoring

A tutorial of eye tracking of dlib_eyes.py can be found here https://towardsdatascience.com/real-time-eye-tracking-using-opencv-and-dlib-b504ca724ac6.

For running yolov3.py the pretrained weights need to be downloaded which can be done by uncommenting the wget line in it and adding import wget.
